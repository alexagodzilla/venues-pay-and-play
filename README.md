Rails app generated with a [Le Wagon's Rails template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), using PostgreSQL, Sassy CSS, Bootstrap and Stimulus, to create an app linking amateur musicians to venues that they can rent for practice. Users can view and book venues, leave a review if they booked it, and upload and edit their own venues.
